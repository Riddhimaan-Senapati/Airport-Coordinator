# Airport Coordinator App
This is a simple website to help international students coordinate with other international students when they are going to arrive at an airport. It takes in your email address (currently only accepts @umass.edu email accounts), flight arrival time and your airport as well as a threshold of how long you are willing to stay at the airport. It then shows the email address and flight arrival times of those people who are arriving at the airport between your flight arrival time and the threshold you set.

# Inspiration

I was inspired by how it difficult it was to coordinate among international students for a rideshare. It involved going through hundreds of WhatsApp messages. So I decided to create a website that would act as place where people could input their flight arrival time and find people who were close by.

# How I built it
I built it using React, Mongo DB, express and hosted on vercel for frontend, railway for backend.
